title: Learning Partially Contracting Dynamical Systems from Demonstrations
abstract: An algorithm for learning the dynamics of point-to-point motions from demonstrations
  using an autonomous nonlinear dynamical system, named contracting dynamical system
  primitives (CDSP), is presented. The motion dynamics are approximated using a Gaussian
  mixture model (GMM) and its parameters are learned subject to constraints derived
  from partial contraction analysis. Systems learned using the proposed method generate
  trajectories that accurately reproduce the demonstrations and are guaranteed to
  converge to a desired goal location. Additionally, the learned models are capable
  of quickly and appropriately adapting to unexpected spatial perturbations and changes
  in goal location during reproductions. The CDSP algorithm is evaluated on shapes
  from a publicly available human handwriting dataset and also compared with two state-of-the-art
  motion generation algorithms. Furthermore, the CDSP algorithm is also shown to be
  capable of learning and reproducing point-to-point motions directly from real-world
  demonstrations using a Baxter robot.
