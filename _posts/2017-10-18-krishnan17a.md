title: 'DDCO: Discovery of Deep Continuous Options for Robot Learning from Demonstrations'
abstract: 'An option is a short-term skill consisting of a control policy for a specified
  region of the state space, and a termination condition recognizing leaving that
  region. In prior work, we proposed an algorithm called Deep Discovery of Options
  (DDO) to discover options to accelerate reinforcement learning in Atari games. This
  paper studies an extension to robot imitation learning, called Discovery of Deep
  Continuous Options (DDCO), where low-level continuous control skills parametrized
  by deep neural networks are learned from demonstrations. We extend DDO with: (1)
  a hybrid categorical-continuous distribution model to parametrize high-level policies
  that can invoke discrete options as well continuous control actions, and (2) a cross-validation
  method that relaxes DDOâ€™s requirement that users specify the number of options to
  be discovered. We evaluate DDCO in simulation of a 3-link robot in the vertical
  plane pushing a block with friction and gravity, and in two physical experiments
  on the da Vinci surgical robot, needle insertion where a needle is grasped and inserted
  into a silicone tissue phantom, and needle bin picking where needles and pins are
  grasped from a pile and categorized into bins. In the 3-link arm simulation, results
  suggest that DDCO can take 3x fewer demonstrations to achieve the same reward compared
  to a baseline imitation learning approach. In the needle insertion task, DDCO was
  successful 8/10 times compared to the next most accurate imitation learning baseline
  6/10. In the surgical bin picking task, the learned policy successfully grasps a
  single object in 66 out of 99 attempted grasps, and in all but one case successfully
  recovered from failed grasps by retrying a second time.'
