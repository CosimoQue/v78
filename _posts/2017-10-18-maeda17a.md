title: Active Incremental Learning of Robot Movement Primitives
abstract: Robots that can learn over time by interacting with non-technical users
  must be capable of acquiring new motor skills, incrementally. The problem then is
  deciding when to teach the robot a new skill or when to rely on the robot generalizing
  its actions. This decision can be made by the robot if it is provided with means
  to quantify the suitability of its own skill given an unseen task. To this end,
  we present an algorithm that allows a robot to make active requests to incrementally
  learn  movement primitives. A movement primitive is learned on a trajectory output
  by a Gaussian Process. The latter is used as a library of demonstrations that can
  be extrapolated with confidence margins. This combination not only allows the robot
  to generalize using as few as a single demonstration but more importantly, to indicate
  when such generalization can be executed with confidence or not. In experiments,
  a real robot arm indicates to the user which demonstrations should be provided to
  increase its repertoire of reaching skills. Experiments will also show that the
  robot becomes confident in reaching objects for whose demonstrations were never
  provided, by incrementally learning from the neighboring demonstrations.
