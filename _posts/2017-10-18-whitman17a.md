title: Learning Dynamics Across Similar Spatiotemporally-Evolving Physical Systems
abstract: We present a differentially-constrained machine learning model that can
  generalize over similar spatiotemporally evolving dynamical systems. It is shown
  that not only can an E-GP model be used to estimate the latent state of large-scale
  physical systems of this type, but that a single E-GP model can generalize over
  multiple physically-similar systems over a range of parameters using only a few
  training sets. This is demonstrated on computational flow dynamics (CFD) data sets
  on fluid flowing past a cylinder at different Reynolds numbers. Though these systems
  are governed by highly nonlinear partial differential equations (the Navier-Stokes
  equations), we show that their major dynamical modes can be captured by a linear
  dynamical layer over the temporal evolution of the weights of stationary kernels.
  Furthermore, the model generated by this method provides easy access to physical
  insights into the system, unlike comparable methods like Recurrent Neural Networks
  (RNN). The low computational cost of this method suggests that it has the potential
  to enable machine learning approximations of complex physical phenomena for autonomy
  and robotic design tasks.
