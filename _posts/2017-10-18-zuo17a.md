title: 'Fast Residual Forests: Rapid Ensemble Learning for Semantic Segmentation'
abstract: In recent times, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches have
  performed exceptionally well in many computer vision related tasks, including classification
  and segmentation. These approaches have shown that given enough training data and
  time, they can often perform at a level significantly higher than the alternative
  methods. However, in the context of robotic learning, it is commonly the case that
  both time and training data are limited. In this work, we propose a learning approach
  that is more suitable for robotic learning; it substantially reduces the time required
  to learn and provides much higher performance when training data is limited. Our
  method combines random forests with deep convolution networks, leveraging the strengths
  of both frameworks. We develop a method for generating derivatives from our highly
  non-linear forest classifier which in turn enables training of the CNN. Furthermore,
  our method allows leaf distributions in the ensemble classifier to be trained jointly
  with one another using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), allowing for parallel
  training of a large number of tree classifiers at once. This results in a drastic
  increase in training speed. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvements
  over pure deep learning methods, notably on datasets with limited training data.
  We apply our method to the outdoor and indoor segmentation datasets of KITTI and
  NYUv2-40, outperforming multiple pure deep learning methods whilst using a fraction
  of training time normally required.
