title: 'Fastron: An Online Learning-Based Model and Active Learning Strategy for Proxy
  Collision Detection'
abstract: We introduce the Fastron, a configuration space (C-space) model to be used
  as a proxy to kinematic-based collision detection. The Fastron allows iterative
  updates to account for a changing environment through a combination of a novel formulation
  of the kernel perceptron learning algorithm and an active learning strategy. Our
  simulations on a 7 degree-of-freedom arm indicate that proxy collision checks may
  be performed at least 2 times faster than an efficient polyhedral collision checker
  and at least 8 times faster than an efficient high-precision collision checker.
  The Fastron model provides conservative collision status predictions by padding
  C-space obstacles, and proxy collision checking time does not scale poorly as the
  number of workspace obstacles increases. All results were achieved without GPU acceleration
  or parallel computing.
