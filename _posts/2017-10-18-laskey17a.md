title: 'DART: Noise Injection for Robust Imitation Learning'
abstract: 'One approach to Imitation Learning is  Behavior Cloning, in which a robot
  observes a supervisor and infers a control policy. A known problem with this “off-policy"
  approach is that the robot’s errors compound when drifting away from the supervisor’s
  demonstrations.  On-policy, techniques alleviate this by iteratively collecting
  corrective actions for the current robot policy. However, these techniques can be
  difficult for human supervisors, add significant computation burden, and require
  the robot to visit potentially dangerous states during training.  We propose an
  off-policy approach that \emphinjects noise into the supervisor’s policy while demonstrating.
  This forces the supervisor and robot to explore and recover from errors without
  letting them compound. We propose a new algorithm, DART, that collects demonstrations
  with injected noise, and optimizes the noise level to approximate the error of the
  robot’s trained policy during data collection.  We  provide a theoretical analysis
  to illustrate that DART reduces covariate shift more than Behavior Cloning for a
  robot with non-zero error. We evaluate DART in two domains: in simulation with an
  algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo locomotive tasks and in physical experiments
  with human supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter.  For
  challenging tasks like Humanoid, DART can be up to $280%$ faster in computation
  time and only decreases the supervisor’s cumulative reward by $5%$ during training,
  whereas DAgger executes policies that have $80%$ less cumulative reward than the
  supervisor.  On the grasping in clutter task, DART obtains on average $62%$ performance
  increase over Behavior Cloning.'
