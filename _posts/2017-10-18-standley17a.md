title: 'image2mass: Estimating the Mass of an Object from Its Image'
abstract: Successful robotic manipulation of real-world objects requires an understanding
  of the physical properties of these objects.  We propose a model for estimating
  one such physical property, mass, from an objectâ€™s image. We collect a large dataset
  of online product information containing images, sizes, and weights. We compare
  several baseline models for the image-to-mass problem that were trained on this
  dataset. We also characterize human performance on the problem. Finally, we present
  a model that takes into account an estimate of the 3D shape of the object. This
  model performs significantly better than these baselines and compares favorably
  to the performance of humans. All models are tested on a held-out set of product
  data, as well as a relatively small dataset that we captured with a scale and a
  digital camera.
