title: 'Intention-Net: Integrating Planning and Deep Learning for Goal-Directed Autonomous
  Navigation'
abstract: How can a delivery robot navigate reliably to a destination in a new office
  building, with minimal prior information? To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces
  a two-level hierarchical approach, which integrates model-free deep learning and
  model-based path planning. At the low level, a neural-network motion controller,
  called the intention-net, is trained end-to-end to provide robust local navigation.
  The intention-net maps images from a single monocular camera and “intentions” directly
  to robot controls. At the high level, a path planner uses a crude map, e.g., a 2-D
  floor plan, to compute a path from the robot’s current location to the goal. The
  planned path provides intentions to the intention-net. Preliminary experiments suggest
  that the learned motion controller is robust against perceptual uncertainty and
  by integrating with a path planner, it generalizes effectively to new environments
  and goals.
