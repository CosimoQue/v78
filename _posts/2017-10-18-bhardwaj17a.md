title: Learning Heuristic Search via Imitation
abstract: 'Robotic motion planning problems are typically solved by constructing a
  search tree of valid maneuvers from a start to a goal configuration. Limited onboard
  computation and real-time planning constraints impose a limit on how large this
  search tree can grow. Heuristics play a crucial role in such situations by guiding
  the search towards potentially good directions and consequently minimizing search
  effort. Moreover, it must infer such directions in an efficient manner using only
  the information uncovered by the search up until that time. However, state of the
  art methods do not address the problem of computing a heuristic that \emphexplicitly
  minimizes search effort. In this paper, we do so by training a heuristic policy
  that maps the partial information from the search to decide which node of the search
  tree to expand. Unfortunately, naively training such policies leads to slow convergence
  and poor local minima. We present \textscSaIL, an efficient algorithm that trains
  heuristic policies by imitating \emphclairvoyant oracles - oracles that have full
  information about the world and demonstrate decisions that minimize search effort.
  We leverage the fact that such oracles can be efficiently computed using dynamic
  programming and derive performance guarantees for the learnt heuristic. We validate
  the approach on a spectrum of environments which show that \textscSaIL consistently
  outperforms state of the art algorithms. Our approach paves the way forward for
  learning heuristics that demonstrate an anytime nature - finding feasible solutions
  quickly and incrementally refining it over time. Open-source code and details can
