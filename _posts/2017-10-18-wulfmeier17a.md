title: Mutual Alignment Transfer Learning
abstract: Training robots for operation in the real world is a complex, time consuming
  and potentially expensive task. Despite significant success of reinforcement learning
  in games and simulations, research in real robot applications has not been able
  to match similar progress.  While sample complexity can be reduced by training policies
  in simulation, these can perform sub-optimally on the real platform given imperfect
  calibration of model dynamics. We present an approach - supplemental to fine tuning
  on the real robot - to further benefit from parallel access to a simulator during
  training. The developed approach harnesses auxiliary rewards to guide the exploration
  for the real world agent based on the proficiency of the agent in simulation and
  vice versa. In this context, we demonstrate empirically that the reciprocal alignment
  for both agents provides further benefit as the agent in simulation can adjust to
  optimize its behaviour for states commonly visited by the real-world agent.
