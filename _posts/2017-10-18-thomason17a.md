title: Opportunistic Active Learning for Grounding Natural Language Descriptions
abstract: Active learning identifies data points from a pool of unlabeled examples
  whose labels, if made available, are most likely to improve the predictions of a
  supervised model. Most research on active learning assumes that an agent has access
  to the entire pool of unlabeled data and can ask for labels of any data points during
  an initial training phase. However, when incorporated in a larger task, an agent
  may only be able to query some subset of the unlabeled pool. An agent can also opportunistically
  query for labels that may be useful in the future, even if they are not immediately
  relevant. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of opportunistic active learning
  can improve performance in grounding natural language descriptions of everyday objects—an
  important skill for home and office robots. We find, with a real robot in an object
  identification setting, that inquisitive behavior—asking users important questions
  about the meanings of words that may be off-topic for the current dialog—leads to
  identifying the correct object more often over time.
