title: Transferring End-to-End Visuomotor Control from Simulation to Real World for
  a Multi-Stage Task
abstract: End-to-end control for robot manipulation and grasping is emerging as an
  attractive alternative to traditional pipelined approaches. However, end-to-end
  methods tend to either be slow to train, exhibit little or no generalisability,
  or lack the ability to accomplish long-horizon or multi-stage tasks. In this paper,
  we show how two simple techniques can lead to end-to-end (image to velocity) execution
  of a multi-stage task, which is analogous to a simple tidying routine, without having
  seen a single real image. This involves locating, reaching for, and grasping a cube,
  then locating a basket and dropping the cube inside. To achieve this, robot trajectories
  are computed in a simulator, to collect a series of control velocities which accomplish
  the task. Then, a CNN is trained to map observed images to velocities, using domain
  randomisation to enable generalisation to real world images. Results show that we
  are able to successfully accomplish the task in the real world with the ability
  to generalise to novel environments, including those with dynamic lighting conditions,
  distractor objects, and moving objects, including the basket itself. We believe
  our approach to be simple, highly scalable, and capable of learning long-horizon
  tasks that have until now not been shown with the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
  robot control.
