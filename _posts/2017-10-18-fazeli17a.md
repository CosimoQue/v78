title: 'Learning Data-Efficient Rigid-Body Contact Models: Case Study of Planar Impact'
abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of common rigid-body contact
  models used in the robotics community by comparing them to a collection of data-driven
  and data-reinforced models that exploit underlying structure inspired by the rigid
  contact  paradigm. We evaluate and compare the analytical and data-driven contact
  models on an empirical planar impact data-set, and show that the learned models
  are able to outperform their analytical counterparts with a small training set.
