title: 'Bayesian Interaction Primitives: A SLAM Approach to Human-Robot Interaction'
abstract: This paper introduces a fully Bayesian reformulation of Interaction Primitives
  for human-robot interaction and collaboration. A key insight is that a subset of
  human-robot interaction is conceptually related to simultaneous localization and
  mapping techniques. Leveraging this insight we can significantly increase the accuracy
  of temporal estimation and inferred trajectories while simultaneously reducing the
  associated computational complexity. We show that this enables more complex human-robot
  interaction scenarios involving more degrees of freedom.
