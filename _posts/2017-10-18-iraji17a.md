title: Principal Variety Analysis
abstract: We introduce a novel computational framework, Principal Variety Analysis
  (PVA), for primarily nonlinear data modeling. PVA accommodates algebraic sets as
  the target subspace through which limitations of other existing approaches is dealt
  with. PVA power is demonstrated in this paper for learning kinematics of objects,
  as an important application. PVA takes recorded coordinates of some pre-specified
  features on the objects as input and outputs a lowest dimensional variety on which
  the feature coordinates jointly lie. Unlike existing object modeling methods, which
  require entire trajectories of objects, PVA requires much less information and provides
  more flexible and generalizable models, namely an analytical algebraic kinematic
  model of the objects, even in unstructured, uncertain environments. Moreover, it
  is not restricted to predetermined model templates and is capable of extracting
  much more general types of models. Besides finding the kinematic model of objects,
  PVA can be a powerful tool to estimate their corresponding degrees of freedom. PVA
  computational success depends on exploiting sparsity, in particular algebraic dimension
  minimization through replacement of intractable $\ell_0$ norm (rank) with tractable
  $\ell_1$ norm (nuclear norm). Complete characterization of the assumptions under
  which $\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ norm minimizations yield virtually the same outcome
  is introduced as an important open problem in this paper.
