title: Semi-Supervised Haptic Material Recognition for Robots using Generative Adversarial
  Networks
abstract: Material recognition enables robots to incorporate knowledge of material
  properties into their interactions with everyday objects. For example, material
  recognition opens up opportunities for clearer communication with a robot, such
  as "bring me the metal coffee mug", and recognizing plastic versus metal is crucial
  when using a microwave or oven. However, collecting labeled training data with a
  robot is often more difficult than unlabeled data. We present a semi-supervised
  learning approach for material recognition that uses generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) with haptic features such as force, temperature, and vibration. Our approach
  achieves state-of-the-art results and enables a robot to estimate the material class
  of household objects with Â 90% accuracy when 92% of the training data are unlabeled.
  We explore how well this approach can recognize the material of new objects and
  we discuss challenges facing generalization. To motivate learning from unlabeled
  training data, we also compare results against several common supervised learning
  classifiers. In addition, we have released the dataset used for this work which
  consists of time-series haptic measurements from a robot that conducted thousands
  of interactions with 72 household objects.
