title: Learning Stable Task Sequences from Demonstration with Linear Parameter Varying
  Systems and Hidden Markov Models
abstract: 'The problem of acquiring multiple tasks from demonstration is typically
  divided in two sequential processes: (1) the segmentation or identification of different
  subgoals/subtasks and (2) a separate learning process that parameterizes a control
  policy for each subtask. As a result, segmentation criteria typically neglect the
  characteristics of control policies and rely instead on simplified models. This
  paper aims for a single model capable of learning sequences of complex time-independent
  control policies that provide robust and stable behavior. To this end, we first
  present a novel and efficient approach to learn goal-oriented time-independent motion
  models by estimating \emphboth attractor and dynamic behavior from data guaranteeing
  stability using linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.  This method enables learning
  complex task sequences with hidden Markov models (HMMs), where each state/subtask
  is given by a stable LPV system and where transitions are most likely around the
  corresponding attractor. We study the dynamics of the HMM-LPV model and propose
  a motion generation method that guarantees the stability of task sequences. We validate
  our approach in two sets of demonstrated human motions.'
