title: 'The Intentional Unintentional Agent: Learning to Solve Many Continuous Control
  Tasks Simultaneously'
abstract: This paper introduces the Intentional Unintentional (IU) agent. This agent
  endows the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) agent for continuous control
  with the ability to solve several tasks simultaneously. Learning to solve many tasks
  simultaneously has been a long-standing, core goal of artificial intelligence, inspired
  by infant development and motivated by the desire to build flexible robot manipulators
  capable of many diverse behaviours. We show that the IU agent not only learns to
  solve many tasks simultaneously but it also learns faster than agents that target
  a single task at-a-time. In some cases, where the single task DDPG method completely
  fails, the IU agent successfully solves the task. To demonstrate this, we build
  a playroom environment using the MuJoCo physics engine, and introduce a grounded
  formal language to automatically generate tasks.
