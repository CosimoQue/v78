title: Sim-to-Real Robot Learning from Pixels with Progressive Nets
abstract: Applying end-to-end learning to solve complex, interactive, pixel-driven
  control tasks on a robot is an unsolved problem. Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms
  are too slow to achieve performance on a real robot, but their potential has been
  demonstrated in simulated environments. We propose using \emphprogressive networks
  to bridge the reality gap and transfer learned policies from simulation to the real
  world. The progressive net approach is a general framework that enables reuse of
  everything from low-level visual features to high-level policies for transfer to
  new tasks, enabling a compositional, yet simple, approach to building complex skills.
  We present an early demonstration of this approach with a number of experiments
  in the domain of robot manipulation that focus on bridging the reality gap. Unlike
  other proposed approaches, our real-world experiments demonstrate successful task
  learning from raw visual input on a fully actuated robot manipulator. Moreover,
  rather than relying on model-based trajectory optimisation, the task learning is
  accomplished using only deep reinforcement learning and sparse rewards.
