title: 'CORe50: a New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition'
abstract: Continuous/Lifelong learning of high-dimensional data streams is a challenging
  research problem. In fact, fully retraining models each time new data become available
  is infeasible, due to computational and storage issues, while na√Øve incremental
  strategies have been shown to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In the context
  of real-world object recognition applications (e.g., robotic vision), where continuous
  learning is crucial, very few datasets and benchmarks are available to evaluate
  and compare emerging techniques. In this work we propose a new dataset and benchmark
  CORe50, specifically designed for continuous object recognition, and introduce baseline
  approaches for different continuous learning scenarios.
