title: Reverse Curriculum Generation for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Many relevant tasks require an agent to reach a certain state, or to manipulate
  objects into a desired configuration. For example, we might want a robot to align
  and assemble a gear onto an axle or insert and turn a key in a lock. These goal-oriented
  tasks present a considerable challenge for reinforcement learning, since their natural
  reward function is sparse and prohibitive amounts of exploration are required to
  reach the goal and receive some learning signal. Past approaches tackle these problems
  by exploiting expert demonstrations or by manually designing a task-specific reward
  shaping function to guide the learning agent. Instead, we propose a method to learn
  these tasks without requiring any prior knowledge other than obtaining a single
  state in which the task is achieved.  The robot is trained in “reverse", gradually
  learning to reach the goal from a set of starting positions increasingly far from
  the goal. Our method automatically generates a curriculum of starting positions
  that adapts to the agent’s performance, leading to efficient training on goal-oriented
  tasks.  We demonstrate our approach on difficult simulated navigation and fine-grained
  manipulation problems, not solvable by state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.
