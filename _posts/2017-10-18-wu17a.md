title: Emergent Behaviors in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic
abstract: Traffic dynamics are often modeled by complex dynamical systems for which
  classical analysis tools can struggle to provide tractable policies used by transportation
  agencies and planners. In light of the introduction of automated vehicles into transportation
  systems, there is a new need for understanding the impacts of automation on transportation
  networks. The present article formulates and approaches the mixed-autonomy traffic
  control problem (where both automated and human-driven vehicles are present) using
  the powerful framework of deep reinforcement learning (RL). The resulting policies
  and emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy traffic settings provide insight for the
  potential for automation of traffic through mixed fleets of automated and manned
  vehicles. Model-free learning methods are shown to naturally select policies and
  behaviors previously designed by model-driven approaches, such as stabilization
  and platooning, known to improve ring road efficiency and to even exceed a theoretical
  velocity limit. Remarkably, RL succeeds at maximizing velocity by effectively leveraging
  the structure of the human driving behavior to form an efficient vehicle spacing
  for an intersection network. We describe our results in the context of existing
  control theoretic results for stability analysis and mixed-autonomy analysis. This
  article additionally introduces state equivalence classes to improve the sample
  complexity for the learning methods.
