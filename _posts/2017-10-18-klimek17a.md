title: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Parameters
abstract: In this work we introduce and evaluate a model of Hierarchical Reinforcement
  Learning with Parameters. In the first stage we train agents to execute relatively
  simple actions like reaching or gripping. In the second stage we train a hierarchical
  manager to compose these actions to solve more complicated tasks.  The manager may
  pass parameters to agents thus controlling details of undertaken actions.  The hierarchical
  approach with parameters can be used with any optimization algorithm.   In this
  work we adapt to our setting methods described in [1]. We show that their theoretical
  foundation, including monotonicity of improvements, still holds. We experimentally
  compare the hierarchical reinforcement learning with the standard, non-hierarchical
  approach and conclude that the hierarchical learning with parameters is a viable
  way to improve final results and stability of learning.
