title: Optimizing Long-term Predictions for Model-based Policy Search
abstract: " We propose a novel long-term optimization criterion to improve the robustness
  of model-based reinforcement learning in real-world scenarios. Learning a dynamics
  model to derive a solution promises much greater data-efficiency and reusability
  compared to model-free alternatives. In practice, however, modelbased RL suffers
  from various imperfections such as noisy input and output data, delays and unmeasured
  (latent) states. To achieve higher resilience against such effects, we propose to
  optimize a generative long-term prediction model directly with respect to the likelihood
  of observed trajectories as opposed to the common approach of optimizing a dynamics
  model for one-step-ahead predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on several
  artificial and real-world benchmark problems and compare it to PILCO, a model-based
  RL framework, in experiments on a manipulation robot. The results show that the
  proposed method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art model learning methods.
  In contrast to these more involved models, our model can directly be employed for
  policy search and outperforms a baseline method in the robot experiment."
