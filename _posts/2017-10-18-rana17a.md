title: 'Towards Robust Skill Generalization: Unifying Learning from Demonstration
  and Motion Planning'
abstract: In this paper, we present Combined Learning from demonstration And Motion
  Planning (CLAMP) as an efficient approach to skill learning and generalizable skill
  reproduction. CLAMP combines the strengths of Learning from Demonstration (LfD)
  and motion planning into a unifying framework. We carry out probabilistic inference
  to find trajectories which are optimal with respect to a given skill and also feasible
  in different scenarios. We use factor graph optimization to speed up inference.
  To encode optimality, we provide a new probabilistic skill model based on a stochastic
  dynamical system. This skill model requires minimal parameter tuning to learn, is
  suitable to encode skill constraints, and allows efficient inference. Preliminary
  experimental results showing skill generalization over initial robot state and unforeseen
  obstacles are presented.
