title: 'Self-Supervised Visual Planning with Temporal Skip Connections '
abstract: 'In order to autonomously learn wide repertoires of complex skills, robots
  must be able to learn from their own autonomously collected data, without human
  supervision. One learning signal that is always available for autonomously collected
  data is prediction. If a robot can learn to predict the future, it can use this
  predictive model to take actions to produce desired outcomes, such as moving an
  object to a particular location. However, in complex open-world scenarios, designing
  a representation for prediction is difficult. In this work, we instead aim to enable
  self-supervised robot learning through direct video prediction: instead of attempting
  to design a good representation, we directly predict what the robot will see next,
  and then use this model to achieve desired goals. A key challenge in video prediction
  for robotic manipulation is handling complex spatial arrangements such as occlusions.
  To that end, we introduce a video prediction model that can keep track of objects
  through occlusion by incorporating temporal skip-connections. Together with a novel
  planning criterion and action space formulation, we demonstrate that this model
  substantially outperforms prior work on video prediction-based control. Our results
  show manipulation of objects not seen during training, handling multiple objects,
  and pushing objects around obstructions. These results represent a significant advance
  in the range and complexity of skills that can be performed entirely with self-supervised
  robot learning. '
