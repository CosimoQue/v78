title: Learning Deep Policies for Robot Bin Picking by Simulating Robust Grasping
  Sequences
abstract: Recent results suggest that it is possible to grasp a variety of singulated
  objects with high precision using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on
  synthetic data. This paper considers the task of bin picking, where multiple objects
  are randomly arranged in a heap and the objective is to sequentially grasp and transport
  each into a packing box. We model bin picking with a discrete-time Partially Observable
  Markov Decision Process that specifies states of the heap, point cloud observations,
  and rewards. We collect synthetic demonstrations of bin picking from an algorithmic
  supervisor uses full state information to optimize for the most robust collision-free
  grasp in a forward simulator based on pybullet to model dynamic object-object interactions
  and robust wrench space analysis from the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) to model quasi-static
  contact between the gripper and object. We learn a policy by fine-tuning a Grasp
  Quality CNN on Dex-Net 2.1 to classify the supervisorâ€™s actions from a dataset of
  10,000 rollouts of the supervisor in the simulator with noise injection. In 2,192
  physical trials of bin picking with an ABB YuMi on a dataset of 50 novel objects,
  we find that the resulting policies can achieve 94$%$ success rate and 96$%$ average
  precision (very few false positives) on heaps of 5-10 objects and can clear heaps
  of 10 objects in under three minutes. Datasets, experiments, and supplemental material
  are available at \urlhttp://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net.
