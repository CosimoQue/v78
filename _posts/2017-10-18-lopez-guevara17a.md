title: 'Adaptable Pouring: Teaching Robots Not to Spill using Fast but Approximate
  Fluid Simulation'
abstract: 'Humans manipulate fluids intuitively using intuitive approximations of
  the underlying physical model. In this paper, we explore a general methodology that
  robots may use to develop and improve strategies for overcoming manipulation tasks
  associated with appropriately defined loss functions. We focus on the specific task
  of pouring a liquid from a container (pourer) to another container (receiver) while
  minimizing the mass of liquid that spills outside the receiver. We present a solution,
  based on guidance from approximate simulation, that is fast, flexible and adaptable
  to novel containers as long as their shapes can be sensed. Our key idea is to decouple
  the optimization of the parameter space of the simulator from the optimization over
  action space for determining robot control actions. We perform the former in a training
  (calibration) stage and the latter during run-time (deployment).  For the purpose
  of this paper we use pouring in both stages, even though separate actions could
  be chosen. We compare four different strategies for calibration and three different
  strategies for deployment. Our results demonstrate that fast fluid simulations are
  effective, even if they are only approximate, in guiding automatic strategies for
  pouring liquids. '
