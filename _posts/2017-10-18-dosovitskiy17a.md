title: 'CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator'
abstract: 'We introduce CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.
  CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and
  validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code
  and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles)
  that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform
  supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We
  use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a
  classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and
  an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated
  in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined
  via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platformâ€™s utility for autonomous
  driving research.'
