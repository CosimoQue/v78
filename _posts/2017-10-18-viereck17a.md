title: Learning a visuomotor controller for real world robotic grasping using simulated
  depth images
abstract: We want to build robots that are useful in unstructured real world applications,
  such as doing work in the household. Grasping in particular is an important skill
  in this domain, yet it remains a challenge. One of the key hurdles is handling unexpected
  changes or motion in the objects being grasped and kinematic noise or other errors
  in the robot. This paper proposes an approach to learning a closed-loop controller
  for robotic grasping that dynamically guides the gripper to the object. We use a
  wrist-mounted sensor to acquire depth images in front of the gripper and train a
  convolutional neural network to learn a distance function to true grasps for grasp
  configurations over an image. The training sensor data is generated in simulation,
  a major advantage over previous work that uses real robot experience, which is costly
  to obtain. Despite being trained in simulation, our approach works well on real
  noisy sensor images. We compare our controller in simulated and real robot experiments
  to a strong baseline for grasp pose detection, and find that our approach significantly
  outperforms the baseline in the presence of kinematic noise, perceptual errors and
  disturbances of the object during grasping.
