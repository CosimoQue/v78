title: 'Aggressive Deep Driving: Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Model
  Predictive Control'
abstract: We present a framework for vision-based model predictive control (MPC) for
  the task of aggressive, high-speed autonomous driving. Our approach uses deep convolutional
  neural networks to predict cost functions from input video which are directly suitable
  for online trajectory optimization with MPC. We demonstrate the method in a high
  speed autonomous driving scenario, where we use a single monocular camera and a
  deep convolutional neural network to predict a cost map of the track in front of
  the vehicle. Results are demonstrated on a 1:5 scale autonomous vehicle given the
  task of high speed, aggressive driving.
