title: Learning Robotic Manipulation of Granular Media
abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of robotic manipulation of granular
  media. We evaluate multiple predictive models used to infer the dynamics of scooping
  and dumping actions. These models are evaluated on a task that involves manipulating
  the media in order to deform it into a desired  shape. Our best performing model
  is based on a highly-tailored convolutional network architecture with domain-specific
  optimizations, which we show accurately models the physical interaction of the robotic
  scoop with the underlying media. We empirically demonstrate that explicitly predicting
  physical mechanics results in a policy that out-performs both a hand-crafted dynamics
  baseline, and a “value-network”, which must otherwise implicitly predict the same
  mechanics in order to produce accurate value estimates.
