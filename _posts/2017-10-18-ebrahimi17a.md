title: Gradient-free Policy Architecture Search and Adaptation
abstract: We develop a method for policy architecture search and adaptation via gradient-free
  optimization which can learn to perform autonomous driving tasks.  By  learning
  from both demonstration and environmental reward we develop a model that can learn
  with relatively few early catastrophic failures.  We first learn an architecture
  of appropriate complexity to perceive aspects of world state relevant to the expert
  demonstration, and then mitigate the effect of domain-shift during deployment by
  adapting a policy demonstrated in a source domain to rewards obtained in a target
  environment. We show that our approach allows safer learning than baseline methods,  offering
  a reduced cumulative crash metric over the agentâ€™s lifetime as it learns to drive
  in a realistic simulated environment.
