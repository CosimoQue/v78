title: Efficient Automatic Perception System Parameter Tuning On Site without Expert
  Supervision
abstract: Many modern perception systems require human engineers to tune parameters
  in order to adapt to various environments and applications. This incurs a large
  startup cost when deploying a robotic system by relying on human expertise and ground
  truth instrumentation. To alleviate this, we propose a technique using empirical
  trials to automatically tune a perception systemâ€™s parameters on-site without expert
  supervision. Our approach extends upon recent work on introspecting perception performance
  and uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the parameter configuration
  space. We validate our technique by tuning the laser and visual odometry systems
  of a physical ground robot in a variety of environments, achieving estimation errors
  competitive with baseline approaches that use ground truth.
