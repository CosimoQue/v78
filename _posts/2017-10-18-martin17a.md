title: Extending Model-based Policy Gradients for Robots in Heteroscedastic Environments
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider the problem of learning robot control policies
  in heteroscedastic environments, whose noise properties vary throughout a robotâ€™s
  state and action space. We consider reinforcement learning algorithms that evaluate
  policies using learned models of the environment, and we extend this class of algorithms
  to capture heteroscedastic effects with two enchained Gaussian processes. We explore
  the capabilities and limitations of this approach, and demonstrate that it reduces
  model bias across a variety of simulated robotic systems. '
