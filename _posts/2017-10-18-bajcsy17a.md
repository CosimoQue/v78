title: Learning Robot Objectives from Physical Human Interaction
abstract: 'When humans and robots work in close proximity, physical interaction is
  inevitable.  Traditionally, robots treat physical interaction as a disturbance,
  and resume their original behavior after the interaction ends. In contrast, we argue
  that physical human interaction is informative: it is useful information about how
  the robot should be doing its task.  We formalize learning from such interactions
  as a dynamical system in which the task objective has parameters that are part of
  the hidden state, and physical human interactions are observations about these parameters.
  We derive an online approximation of the robot’s optimal policy in this system,
  and test it in a user study. The results suggest that learning from physical interaction
  leads to better robot task performance with less human effort.'
