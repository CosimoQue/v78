title: 'The Feeling of Success: Does Touch Sensing Help Predict Grasp Outcomes?'
abstract: A successful grasp requires careful balancing of the contact forces.  Deducing
  whether a particular grasp will be successful from indirect measurements, such as
  vision, is therefore quite challenging, and direct sensing of contacts through touch
  sensing provides an appealing avenue toward more successful and consistent robotic
  grasping.  However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp
  outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction
  accuracy when combined with other modalities.  Doing so using conventional model-based
  techniques is exceptionally difficult.  In this work, we investigate the question
  of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing
  framework that combines vision and touch.  To that end, we collected more than 9,000
  grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution
  tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network
  models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and
  from both modalities together. Our experimental results indicate that incorporating
  tactile readings substantially improve grasping performance.
