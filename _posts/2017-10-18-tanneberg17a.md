title: Online Learning with Stochastic Recurrent Neural Networks using Intrinsic Motivation
  Signals
abstract: 'Continuous online adaptation is an essential ability for the vision of
  fully autonomous and lifelong-learning robots. Robots need to be able to adapt to
  changing environments and constraints while this adaption should be performed without
  interrupting the robotâ€™s motion. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic
  online motion planning and learning based on a bio-inspired stochastic recurrent
  neural network. Furthermore, we show that the model can adapt online and sample-efficiently
  using intrinsic motivation signals and a mental replay strategy. This fast adaptation
  behavior allows the robot to learn from only a small number of physical interactions
  and is a promising feature for reusing the model in different environments. We evaluate
  the online planning with a realistic dynamic simulation of the KUKA LWR robotic
  arm. The efficient online adaptation is shown in simulation by learning an unknown
  workspace constraint using mental replay and \textitcognitive dissonance as intrinsic
  motivation signal. '
