title: Bayesian Hilbert Maps for Dynamic Continuous Occupancy Mapping
abstract: Hilbert mapping is an efficient technique for building continuous occupancy
  maps from depth sensors such as LiDAR in static environments. However, to make the
  map adaptable to dynamic environments, its parameters need to be learned automatically.
  In this paper, we take a variational Bayesian approach to this problem, thus eliminating
  the regularization term typically adjusted heuristically. We extend the proposed
  model to learn long-term occupancy maps in dynamic environments in a sequential
  fashion, demonstrating the power of kernel methods to capture abstract nonlinear
  patterns and Bayesian learning to construct sophisticated models. Experiments conducted
  in environments with moving vehicles show that the proposed approach has a significant
  speed improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques and maintain a similar or
  better accuracy. We also discuss the robustness against occlusions and various theoretical
  and empirical aspects of building long-term dynamic occupancy maps.
