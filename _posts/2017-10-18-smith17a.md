title: Improved Adversarial Systems for 3D Object Generation and Reconstruction
abstract: This paper describes a new approach for training generative adversarial
  networks (GAN) to understand the detailed 3D shape of objects. While GANs have been
  used in this domain previously, they are notoriously hard to train, especially for
  the complex joint data distribution over 3D objects of many categories and orientations.
  Our method extends previous work by employing the Wasserstein distance normalized
  with gradient penalization as a training objective. This enables improved generation
  from the joint object shape distribution. Our system can also reconstruct 3D shape
  from 2D images and perform shape completion from occluded 2.5D range scans. We achieve
  notable quantitative improvements in comparison to existing baselines.
